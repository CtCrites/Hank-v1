ABOUT:
	Hank is a basic command line virtual assistant. At hte time of his creation, I have had very minimal advanced programming. Most of my programming experience is Scientific, so I am familiar with python.

Hank will be getting improvements. Some prospects include:
	Voice interface
	Personnel files
		
He currently performs the following tasks:
	Animated face movements while talking
	Tells the time as well as date and such
	Reports the weather, retrieved from nearest Regional Airport
	Tells jokes
	Reads the first sentence of a prompted Wikipedia page
